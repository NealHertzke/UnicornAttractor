#UnicornAttractor Issue Tracker

## About

The goal of this application is to provide a ticket based website that provides bug support for users of the Unicorn Attractor fictional application, while also asking payment for feature requests. These requests can be upvoted by users for a small contribution.
In return for these costs, we promise to always spend 50% of our time developing the highest-paid features.
Besides that, the application should be as user-friendly, clean and maintainable as possible.
It is still a work in progress.
